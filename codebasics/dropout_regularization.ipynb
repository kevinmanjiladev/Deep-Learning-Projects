    "# 🌊 **What is the Sonar (Mines vs Rocks) Dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sonar dataset** is a classic binary classification dataset where the goal is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Task**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predict whether a sonar signal was bounced off a metal mine or a rock.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was originally collected for a naval project where submarines send sonar pulses underwater and analyze the returning echoes to detect dangerous mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🧭 **Why this dataset exists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are in a submarine. You send a sound wave (sonar), and it hits something underwater. The echo that comes back contains patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the wave hit a **metal mine**, the echo behaves one way.\n",
    "* If it hit a **rock**, the echo is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists wanted to train **neural networks** to automatically understand these differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, they created the **Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains:\n",

    "* **208 samples total**\n",
    "* **60 numeric features** per sample\n",
    "* **1 label** (Mine or Rock)\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of the 60 features represents:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎚️ **Energy of a sonar signal reflected back at different frequency bands**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the sonar pulse bounces back, the system records its energy at different time/frequency intervals. These energies are numbers between **0.0 and 1.0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So each sample looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0.023, 0.045, 0.123, ..., 0.999, R]\n",
