    "## 🔵 **Machine Learning (ML)**\n",
    "\n",
    "ML is a part of AI where **algorithms learn from data** to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works with **smaller datasets**\n",
    "* Needs **manual feature extraction**\n",
    "  *(You decide what columns/features matter → ex: “word count”, “price”, “age”, etc.)*\n",
    "* Models are **simpler** (ex: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM)\n",
    "* **Trains faster**\n",
    "* Uses **structured data** mostly\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting house prices using features like area, location, number of rooms.\n",

    "## 🔴 **Deep Learning (DL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "DL is a part of ML that uses **Neural Networks with many layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Needs **huge datasets**\n",
    "* Does **automatic feature extraction**\n",
    "  *(The model learns patterns on its own)*\n",
    "* Models are **complex** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)\n",
    "* **Trains slower**, requires **GPUs**\n",
    "* Works great with **images, audio, text**\n",
