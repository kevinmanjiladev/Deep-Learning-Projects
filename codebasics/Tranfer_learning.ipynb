    "Transfer learning is a deep-learning technique where you **take a model that is already trained on a large dataset** and **reuse it for a new task**, instead of training a new model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Simple Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you learned to ride a **bicycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later someone gives you a **motorbike**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t start learning from zero — you already know **balance**, **steering**, **moving forward**, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you learn **faster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in transfer learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model (like MobileNet, VGG16, ResNet) is already trained on millions of images.\n",
    "* It already knows edges, shapes, objects.\n",
    "* You reuse this knowledge for your own problem (flowers, cats vs dogs, diseases, etc).\n",
    "* Training becomes **much faster**, and accuracy becomes **much higher**, even with **small datasets**.\n",

    "### 🧩 How Transfer Learning Works (in Deep Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a pre-trained model**\n",
    "   Example: VGG16 trained on ImageNet (1 million images).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Freeze the early layers**\n",
    "   These layers already detect simple patterns (edges, textures).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Replace the top (classifier) layers**\n",
    "   For example, change the last layer to 5 units for 5 flower classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Train only the new layers**\n",
    "   This requires far less data & time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Why Use Transfer Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **don’t need a huge dataset**\n",
    "* Training is **super fast**\n",
    "* Achieves **better accuracy**\n",
    "* Avoids **overfitting**\n",
    "* Works great for vision, NLP, audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Example (Image Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using MobileNetV2 for classifying flowers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load MobileNetV2 without the last layer\n",
    "* Freeze the base model\n",
    "* Add your own Dense layers\n",
    "* Train only the new layers\n",
    "\n",
    "You get high accuracy even with 1,000 images.\n",
