    "🧠 TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch Explained (Very Simple)\n",

    "✅ 1. TensorFlow\n",
    "---\n",
    "    Think of TensorFlow as a big machine learning engine made by Google.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It helps you build deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It can run on CPU, GPU, and even mobile phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Very good for large-scale production (Google uses it internally).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Key point:\n",
    "TensorFlow is powerful but can be a bit complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Keras\n",
    "---\n",
    "Keras is like a simple and friendly interface built on top of TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine TensorFlow is a big machine ⇒ Keras is the easy dashboard that lets you control the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Easy to write code\n",
    "\n",
    "    Very beginner-friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "    Used for quickly building models\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means Keras now comes inside TensorFlow (tf.keras).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Key point:\n",
    "Keras = Simple wrapper that makes TensorFlow easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. PyTorch\n",
    "---\n",
    "    PyTorch is another deep learning framework made by Facebook (Meta).\n",
    "\n",
    "    More Pythonic → feels like normal Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "    Very popular in research, universities, and experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "    Easy to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dynamic computation graph (flexible)\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Key point:\n",
    "PyTorch is simpler for experimentation and research."
