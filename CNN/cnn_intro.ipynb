    "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for analyzing visual data, such as images and videos, by mimicking the human visual cortex. It automatically detects patterns like edges and shapes, making it essential for image classification, object detection, and segmentation. CNNs operate by applying convolution filters, activation functions (ReLU), and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features.\n"
